This isn't TPO or rolled roofing. It looks more like flat sheet metal on a custom patio build. Is this something insurance has offered to cover?

If so, we may want to encourage the homeowner to source a company like shadeworks or someone who does custom patio stuff. I can have the guys go take a hands on look at it and we can see if there's something we can do, but I think at a minimum for sure we can re-flash that transition but I would be super hesitant to try and change the material type on that patio and stand behind it before getting eyes on it first.",,The hartford,877-805-9918,0,ccoclaims@thehartford.com,,,

Good Afternoon Mr McBride and Mr Mercado

 I can not locate matching laws that exist in Idaho to be able to move this forward due to the submitted itel. A repairability test would be the only way to move from what we wrote to a full replacement.

/////


Hi Patrick,



Thanks for your response.



While Idaho may not have a specific “matching law,” that’s not what this hinges on. The ITEL report confirms the shingles are discontinued and no longer available, which directly impacts the ability to perform a code-compliant repair.



According to the 2018 International Residential Code (IRC):



IRC R908.1 – General
“Materials and methods of application used for recovering or replacing an existing roof covering shall comply with the requirements of Chapter 9. Materials and methods of application shall be in accordance with the manufacturer’s installation instructions and the applicable code.”

🔗 View IRC R908.1 here (Section R908 - UpCodes)


This requires:

Materials to be compatible and uniform

Installation to follow manufacturer specifications

The use of approved and available components



Because these shingles are no longer in production, there are no manufacturer-authorized methods to interlace or replace them in a repair. This creates compatibility and performance issues—making a full replacement the only viable, code-compliant option.



We are happy to proceed with a repairability test if required, but based on code, industry standards, and material availability, this should qualify for a full roof replacement.



Please let me know how you’d like to move forward.",,The hartford,877-805-9918,0,ccoclaims@thehartford.com,Patrick Kelley,8607371802,Patrick.kelley@thehartford.com

BASE ESTIMATE TOTAL
Total for a 36% Margin: $14,118.44
If we can get away with a 35% margin: $13,964.50



NOTES:
Missing one pipe jack measurement for the one over the garage next to the furnace stack. I am guessing a 2""

To stay withing the desired price range I didn't include lifetime pipe boots or ice and water. We had to include labor and materials to build a cricket behind that front porch gable to tie it into the rest of the roof so water diverts away. I left the warranty on there because at least Duration shingles are included. had to include Detach and Reset of gutter screens which is what took this just over $14k. 

If we can get away with a 35% margin, rather than 36%, we can do $13,964.50- please get with your manager on that.  Please ask customer if his current bids include the cricket and labor to work around patio cover and screens. No hidden costs?

Please make sure they clean up around the perimeter of the  house prior to tear off.",,,,,,,,

NOTES: 
1. I only saw 4 pipe jacks, but the inspection is showing 5, so I wrote for 5.

2. If the Power Attic Fan does not work, it needs to be replaced  or l cover it up and install 8 more box vents for a total of 12 if we are not installing Ridge Vent. I The 4 that pre-exist, need to be covered if the power vent works to avoid overventilation and stagnant air.  I am writing this WO/MO with box vents just so we can be prepared. 

3. If we are trashing the Power Fan and going with the 12 box vents, there will be additional charges of ($165.35-not included in bids)

3. Please get attic pics. I am writing for a re-deck since this is 3 layers and will not be suitable for nailing.",,,,,,,,

NOTES:  The lower roof looks like it has a 6"" vent, but the inspection says 4"". Included both.

I wrote for one layer, that part wasn't filled out on the inspection.

The skylight needs better pictures. How does it look? Good condition?  Fissures around the edges? Usually we recommend they be replaced with the roof, as they do not have a long life expectancy, especially the polycarbonate ones. Please get a ROL if they are keeping it.",,,,,,,,

Notes:
- We need an attic inspection on this one before approval

- RoofR picked up the back patio as a 0/12. Can you get a pitch gauge. as long as it's not completely flat we can do rolled roofing, however if it actually is a 0/12 then we technically aren't supposed to so we'd need to look into another flat roofing system like TPO / or possibly get a ROL signed if they want rolled roofing",,,,,,,,

I checked in with Mr miller yesterday but lost the pin to note! 

This was not a viable lead, being that the roof is 13 years old it is young enough to be a small repair. (Roofs typically need replaced 17-25 years old) depending on 3-tab vs architectural 

Boise Market over here does not do small repairs on residential at this time so there wasn’t much we can do to serve him here. 

I referred him over to a handy man to help him out separate from Bartlett!

The manager explained that Play it Again Sports will soon move in next to them and I noticed that end of the building looked like it may have some issues. The PM Tammy said we can go ahead and do an inspection and hopefully this would get our foot in the door for some other inspections through her as well. 

She requested that you send her the report to her email at tammy.cox@cushwake.com.  This building is a big 2 story flat gravel roof. I believe the access is in back but you may want to stop in to Hobby Lobby and let them know so they can help you with access if need be.",,,,,,,,

The back slope is definitely on its last lifeline. The front slope could go another 3 to 5 years. All four of the pipe boots are compromised and I had a conversation with the homeowner in regards to those and what she could do to remedy that and I offered to help her with that. Previous contractor told her that she had a lot of siding that was rotted out, which is true and I showed her the pictures that I took of that damage. In our conversation, I explained to her why she might be having some of that issues when it comes to the siding. That is the lack of gutters on some sections and her sprinkler system. One section that was extremely bad was near a dryer vent that was being blocked by some vegetation. Told her she needs to keep that free and clear. I told her to reach back out to me in the spring and we will reassess from there.",,,,,,,,

Bartlette apparently about a year ago tried to help them it was with Oregon mutual which really sucks and they only got half the roof the roof is completely smoked. I talk to the guy and I he’s going to let me help him try to get the rest of the roof paid for and possibly just file a new claim for the part that didn’t get covered. Which most likely would be the easiest route to take I will go back and do an inspection later today.,,,,,,,,
