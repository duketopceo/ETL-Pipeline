Subject: IREM Application



Hi Randy,



Thank you for suggesting we apply to become part of IREM. Doug wants me to jump right on your recommendation. I believe I am filling out the correct form to be an industry partner.



It looks like we need to have a current CPM member recommendation in order to apply. I have filled out most of the application already to save you some time. If you wouldn't mind filling out the portion that states why you would recommend us and then add your name and phone number where designated then I should be able to get this submitted.



If you need anything else from me please let me know.



Thank you.",,,,,,,,,True,Ashley Kimmel,False,

The back slope is definitely on its last lifeline. The front slope could go another 3 to 5 years. All four of the pipe boots are compromised and I had a conversation with the homeowner in regards to those and what she could do to remedy that and I offered to help her with that. Previous contractor told her that she had a lot of siding that was rotted out, which is true and I showed her the pictures that I took of that damage. In our conversation, I explained to her why she might be having some of that issues when it comes to the siding. That is the lack of gutters on some sections and her sprinkler system. One section that was extremely bad was near a dryer vent that was being blocked by some vegetation. Told her she needs to keep that free and clear.

Looks like we are not profitable on either of these when Ian and I plugged in numbers into the estimate builder.

Keaola, if you could update the estimate builder to include the RCV totals for gutters and fascia then we can see where we need to go from there.

To me it looks like the carrier only paid for the total LF of gutters on eaves to be replaced and did not include LF of the downspouts.

And then for fascia they did cover enough LF for all of the fascia on eaves and rakes, but just Xactimates total for fascia is low to where we would need to negotiate more money per LF or maybe can see if the gutter sub can whip up a bid for replacement of the fascia and then send to carrier to supplement.

I did not change anything on the original Xactimate. Looks like the carrier included 552.93 LF as their quantity for the hip/ridge flashing line item they used.

Our Roofr we have says there is only 394.17 LF of hips and ridges.

Let me know and I can revise the Xactimate to include their same line item they used for the hip and ridge. I usually like to keep our quantities reflecting whatever sketch we use for the estimate, but if you wanted me to match their quantity for hip and ridge I can revise the Xactimate.

I feel like the other option would be is to try and call around and see how much lead hip and ridge runs and then we compare that to Xactimate pricing and go from there.",,,,,,,,,True,Stephen Broadley,False,

I The 4 that pre-exist, need to be covered if the power vent works to avoid overventilation and stagnant air.  I am writing this WO/MO with box vents just so we can be prepared.

3. If we are trashing the Power Fan and going with the 12 box vents, there will be additional charges of ($165.35-not included in bids)

Total for a 36% Margin: $14,118.44
If we can get away with a 35% margin: $13,964.50



NOTES:
Missing one pipe jack measurement for the one over the garage next to the furnace stack. I am guessing a 2""

To stay withing the desired price range I didn't include lifetime pipe boots or ice and water. We had to include labor and materials to build a cricket behind that front porch gable to tie it into the rest of the roof so water diverts away. I left the warranty on there because at least Duration shingles are included. had to include Detach and Reset of gutter screens which is what took this just over $14k.

If we can get away with a 35% margin, rather than 36%, we can do $13,964.50- please get with your manager on that.  Please ask customer if his current bids include the cricket and labor to work around patio cover and screens. No hidden costs?

Please make sure they clean up around the perimeter of the  house prior to tear off.",,,,,,,,,True,Richard Macdonald,False,

Good Afternoon Mr McBride and Mr Mercado

 I can not locate matching laws that exist in Idaho to be able to move this forward due to the submitted itel. A repairability test would be the only way to move from what we wrote to a full replacement.

/////


Hi Patrick,



Thanks for your response.



While Idaho may not have a specific “matching law,” that’s not what this hinges on. The ITEL report confirms the shingles are discontinued and no longer available, which directly impacts the ability to perform a code-compliant repair.



According to the 2018 International Residential Code (IRC):



IRC R908.1 – General
“Materials and methods of application used for recovering or replacing an existing roof covering shall comply with the requirements of Chapter 9. Materials and methods of application shall be in accordance with the manufacturer’s installation instructions and the applicable code.”

🔗 View IRC R908.1 here (Section R908 - UpCodes)


This requires:

Materials to be compatible and uniform

Installation to follow manufacturer specifications

The use of approved and available components



Because these shingles are no longer in production, there are no manufacturer-authorized methods to interlace or replace them in a repair. This creates compatibility and performance issues—making a full replacement the only viable, code-compliant option.



We are happy to proceed with a repairability test if required, but based on code, industry standards, and material availability, this should qualify for a full roof replacement.



Please let me know how you’d like to move forward.",,The hartford,877-805-9918,0.0,ccoclaims@thehartford.com,Patrick Kelley,8607371802,Patrick.kelley@thehartford.com,True,Randy Mcbride,True,
