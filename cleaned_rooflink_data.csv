Subject: IREM Application



Hi Randy,



Thank you for suggesting we apply to become part of IREM. Doug wants me to jump right on your recommendation. I believe I am filling out the correct form to be an industry partner.



It looks like we need to have a current CPM member recommendation in order to apply. I have filled out most of the application already to save you some time. If you wouldn't mind filling out the portion that states why you would recommend us and then add your name and phone number where designated then I should be able to get this submitted.



If you need anything else from me please let me know.



Thank you.",Unknown,UT,Unverified Lead,84655

The back slope consisted of a lot of fibers showing. I was unable to find any wind, damaged shingles or appliqué. In fact, it was the same throughout the roof. The back slope is definitely on its last lifeline. The front slope could go another 3 to 5 years. All four of the pipe boots are compromised and I had a conversation with the homeowner in regards to those and what she could do to remedy that and I offered to help her with that. Previous contractor told her that she had a lot of siding that was rotted out, which is true and I showed her the pictures that I took of that damage. In our conversation, I explained to her why she might be having some of that issues when it comes to the siding. That is the lack of gutters on some sections and her sprinkler system. One section that was extremely bad was near a dryer vent that was being blocked by some vegetation. Told her she needs to keep that free and clear. I told her to reach back out to me in the spring and we will reassess from there.",Res - Appointment Set,ID,Inspected,83686

Looks like we are not profitable on either of these when Ian and I plugged in numbers into the estimate builder.

Keaola, if you could update the estimate builder to include the RCV totals for gutters and fascia then we can see where we need to go from there.

To me it looks like the carrier only paid for the total LF of gutters on eaves to be replaced and did not include LF of the downspouts.

And then for fascia they did cover enough LF for all of the fascia on eaves and rakes, but just Xactimates total for fascia is low to where we would need to negotiate more money per LF or maybe can see if the gutter sub can whip up a bid for replacement of the fascia and then send to carrier to supplement. Just need to make sure their bid includes profit if that makes sense.",Unknown,UT,Claim Filed,84029

I did not change anything on the original Xactimate. Looks like the carrier included 552.93 LF as their quantity for the hip/ridge flashing line item they used.

Our Roofr we have says there is only 394.17 LF of hips and ridges.

Let me know and I can revise the Xactimate to include their same line item they used for the hip and ridge. I usually like to keep our quantities reflecting whatever sketch we use for the estimate, but if you wanted me to match their quantity for hip and ridge I can revise the Xactimate.

I feel like the other option would be is to try and call around and see how much lead hip and ridge runs and then we compare that to Xactimate pricing and go from there.",Res - Lead,UT,Measured,84097

And as far as metal goes, we have a very limited amount of options that are warranted under a 3/12.

There was two layers, not a discontinued measurement but the color definitely looked at. The roof was just in bad condition, so it was hard to recognize if there really wasn’t any hail damage. There was a little bit of collateral on the vents. I marked a couple spots that definitely looked like hail hits, but there was also a chimney falling apart with a lot of debris on the roof.

*Patio cover may end up costing more to work around. If this gets homeowner approval, Micah will need to go out and assess the patio cover since it isn't built in a traditional manner.

*I do not have pipe jack measurements, so I wrote all of them to be 3"" so we aren't short $$. Please upload actual pipe measurements for all jobs and fill out the inspection sheet completely so we can give your customer an accurate bid. Thank you : )

*Crew will need to protect the pool with tarps. I will also add a few sheets of osb to the job to cover the end of the pool close to the house.",Res - Inspection,ID,Measured,83642

Notes:
- We need an attic inspection on this one before approval

- RoofR picked up the back patio as a 0/12. Can you get a pitch gauge. as long as it's not completely flat we can do rolled roofing, however if it actually is a 0/12 then we technically aren't supposed to so we'd need to look into another flat roofing system like TPO / or possibly get a ROL signed if they want rolled roofing",Res - Inspection,ID,Measured,83706

NOTES:  The lower roof looks like it has a 6"" vent, but the inspection says 4"". Included both.

I wrote for one layer, that part wasn't filled out on the inspection.

The skylight needs better pictures. How does it look? Good condition?  Fissures around the edges? Usually we recommend they be replaced with the roof, as they do not have a long life expectancy, especially the polycarbonate ones.

NOTES:
1. I only saw 4 pipe jacks, but the inspection is showing 5, so I wrote for 5.

2. If the Power Attic Fan does not work, it needs to be replaced  or l cover it up and install 8 more box vents for a total of 12 if we are not installing Ridge Vent. I The 4 that pre-exist, need to be covered if the power vent works to avoid overventilation and stagnant air.  I am writing this WO/MO with box vents just so we can be prepared.

3. If we are trashing the Power Fan and going with the 12 box vents, there will be additional charges of ($165.35-not included in bids)

3. Please get attic pics. I am writing for a re-deck since this is 3 layers and will not be suitable for nailing.",Unknown,ID,Measured,83704

If we can get away with a 35% margin: $13,964.50



NOTES:
Missing one pipe jack measurement for the one over the garage next to the furnace stack. I am guessing a 2""

To stay withing the desired price range I didn't include lifetime pipe boots or ice and water. We had to include labor and materials to build a cricket behind that front porch gable to tie it into the rest of the roof so water diverts away. I left the warranty on there because at least Duration shingles are included. had to include Detach and Reset of gutter screens which is what took this just over $14k.

If we can get away with a 35% margin, rather than 36%, we can do $13,964.50- please get with your manager on that.  Please ask customer if his current bids include the cricket and labor to work around patio cover and screens. No hidden costs?

Good Afternoon Mr McBride and Mr Mercado

 I can not locate matching laws that exist in Idaho to be able to move this forward due to the submitted itel. A repairability test would be the only way to move from what we wrote to a full replacement.

/////


Hi Patrick,



Thanks for your response.



While Idaho may not have a specific “matching law,” that’s not what this hinges on. The ITEL report confirms the shingles are discontinued and no longer available, which directly impacts the ability to perform a code-compliant repair.



According to the 2018 International Residential Code (IRC):



IRC R908.1 – General
“Materials and methods of application used for recovering or replacing an existing roof covering shall comply with the requirements of Chapter 9. Materials and methods of application shall be in accordance with the manufacturer’s installation instructions and the applicable code.”

🔗 View IRC R908.1 here (Section R908 - UpCodes)


This requires:

Materials to be compatible and uniform

Installation to follow manufacturer specifications

The use of approved and available components



Because these shingles are no longer in production, there are no manufacturer-authorized methods to interlace or replace them in a repair. This creates compatibility and performance issues—making a full replacement the only viable, code-compliant option.



We are happy to proceed with a repairability test if required, but based on code, industry standards, and material availability, this should qualify for a full roof replacement.



Please let me know how you’d like to move forward.",Claim Filed,ID,Signed,83647

This isn't TPO or rolled roofing. It looks more like flat sheet metal on a custom patio build. Is this something insurance has offered to cover?

If so, we may want to encourage the homeowner to source a company like shadeworks or someone who does custom patio stuff. I can have the guys go take a hands on look at it and we can see if there's something we can do, but I think at a minimum for sure we can re-flash that transition but I would be super hesitant to try and change the material type on that patio and stand behind it before getting eyes on it first.",Claim Filed,ID,Signed,83669
