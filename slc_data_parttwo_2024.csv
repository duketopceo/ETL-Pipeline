There was no wind damage, but the homeowner mentioned that they had hail about nine months ago and that some of the neighbors got their roof paid for. I got up and checked it out, looks like someone may be installed the roof by their selves, it was terrible overlapping shingles everywhere. There was two layers, not a discontinued measurement but the color definitely looked at. The roof was just in bad condition, so it was hard to recognize if there really wasn’t any hail damage. There was a little bit of collateral on the vents. I marked a couple spots that definitely looked like hail hits, but there was also a chimney falling apart with a lot of debris on the roof. The homeowner had to leave while I was inspecting, but I am texting him right now.￼",,,,,,,,

He said there's a swamp cooler and he's getting an air conditioner in the Spring. He said he'd like to get the roof done in a few years and he wants to know how much it would be so he could save up.

HOVER shows it as a 2/12, but with it being tar and gravel currently I want to make sure we're offering the best solution possible. Would you be able to get a pitch gauge on the roof to verify? If it's less than a 2/12 we can't do shingles unless he would be willing to sign an ROL, and even then I really wouldn't want him to, just not a great idea.

And as far as metal goes, we have a very limited amount of options that are warranted under a 3/12. We can definitely work something up but it'll take a few days to get pricing and make sure we're writing an accurate bid. Did they mention any preference on metal profile? Most likely it'll have to be a standing seam-type metal panel.",,,,,,,,

I did not change anything on the original Xactimate. Looks like the carrier included 552.93 LF as their quantity for the hip/ridge flashing line item they used. 

Our Roofr we have says there is only 394.17 LF of hips and ridges.

Let me know and I can revise the Xactimate to include their same line item they used for the hip and ridge. I usually like to keep our quantities reflecting whatever sketch we use for the estimate, but if you wanted me to match their quantity for hip and ridge I can revise the Xactimate.

I feel like the other option would be is to try and call around and see how much lead hip and ridge runs and then we compare that to Xactimate pricing and go from there.",,,,,,,,

Looks like we are not profitable on either of these when Ian and I plugged in numbers into the estimate builder.

Keaola, if you could update the estimate builder to include the RCV totals for gutters and fascia then we can see where we need to go from there.

To me it looks like the carrier only paid for the total LF of gutters on eaves to be replaced and did not include LF of the downspouts. 

And then for fascia they did cover enough LF for all of the fascia on eaves and rakes, but just Xactimates total for fascia is low to where we would need to negotiate more money per LF or maybe can see if the gutter sub can whip up a bid for replacement of the fascia and then send to carrier to supplement. Just need to make sure their bid includes profit if that makes sense.",,State farm,800-732-5246,,statefarmfireclaims@statefarm.com,,,

Subject: IREM Application

 

Hi Randy,

 

Thank you for suggesting we apply to become part of IREM. Doug wants me to jump right on your recommendation. I believe I am filling out the correct form to be an industry partner. 

 

It looks like we need to have a current CPM member recommendation in order to apply. I have filled out most of the application already to save you some time. If you wouldn't mind filling out the portion that states why you would recommend us and then add your name and phone number where designated then I should be able to get this submitted. 

 

If you need anything else from me please let me know.

 

Thank you.",,,,,,,,
