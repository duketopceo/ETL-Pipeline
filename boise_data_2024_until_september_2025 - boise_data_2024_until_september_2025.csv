This isn't TPO or rolled roofing. It looks more like flat sheet metal on a custom patio build. Is this something insurance has offered to cover?

If so, we may want to encourage the homeowner to source a company like shadeworks or someone who does custom patio stuff. I can have the guys go take a hands on look at it and we can see if there's something we can do, but I think at a minimum for sure we can re-flash that transition but I would be super hesitant to try and change the material type on that patio and stand behind it before getting eyes on it first.",,The hartford,877-805-9918,0,ccoclaims@thehartford.com,,,

He said don't worry about the sugarloaf address for now, the customers are changing things and we may not be worrying about that one.

I just need to transfer over all my WO/MOs and docs to the new pin so I can work on getting that estimate for you. I told him I have just about everything ready except the burried roof, but I'm working on that today and he said the next few days is totally fine.",,,,,,,,

Notes:
- We need an attic inspection on this one before approval

- RoofR picked up the back patio as a 0/12. Can you get a pitch gauge. as long as it's not completely flat we can do rolled roofing, however if it actually is a 0/12 then we technically aren't supposed to so we'd need to look into another flat roofing system like TPO / or possibly get a ROL signed if they want rolled roofing",,,,,,,,

This was not a viable lead, being that the roof is 13 years old it is young enough to be a small repair. (Roofs typically need replaced 17-25 years old) depending on 3-tab vs architectural 

Boise Market over here does not do small repairs on residential at this time so there wasn’t much we can do to serve him here.

The manager explained that Play it Again Sports will soon move in next to them and I noticed that end of the building looked like it may have some issues. The PM Tammy said we can go ahead and do an inspection and hopefully this would get our foot in the door for some other inspections through her as well. 

She requested that you send her the report to her email at tammy.cox@cushwake.com.  This building is a big 2 story flat gravel roof. I believe the access is in back but you may want to stop in to Hobby Lobby and let them know so they can help you with access if need be.",,,,,,,,

The back slope is definitely on its last lifeline. The front slope could go another 3 to 5 years. All four of the pipe boots are compromised and I had a conversation with the homeowner in regards to those and what she could do to remedy that and I offered to help her with that. Previous contractor told her that she had a lot of siding that was rotted out, which is true and I showed her the pictures that I took of that damage. In our conversation, I explained to her why she might be having some of that issues when it comes to the siding. That is the lack of gutters on some sections and her sprinkler system. One section that was extremely bad was near a dryer vent that was being blocked by some vegetation. Told her she needs to keep that free and clear. I told her to reach back out to me in the spring and we will reassess from there.",,,,,,,,

- Trusses are stick built will be sistering in with additional OSB 
- Added a decking contingency since i'm unsure of how much decking will be needed on day of install 
- ""Decking cost will incur as sheets are pulled and replaced due to truss work, any boards that are found to be needing replacement will be $55 / sheet with the maximum cost of $4,180.00 if a full re-deck is required""
- Steve please let me know if you have any questions for this one or if you would like anything revised!",,,,,,,,

All the shingles are adhering to the shingle below it if the roof is indeed 23 or 24 years old and it’s in pretty good shape. The pipe boots are in good shape as well, see photos.

She has approximately 25 points of damage that are legitimately wind damage and I explained to her that we work with Safeco and we have good luck with them.
